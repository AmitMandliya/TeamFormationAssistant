# Team Formation Assistant
## Problem Statement
Build an assistant which will take the project requirements, team members
availability, skill level, tools preferred, etc. as input and assigns the members for
the new team.
<br/>
## Project Objectives
➢ Design a form for the user to enter data<br/>
➢ Design a dashboard to showcase the generated team assignments<br/>
➢ Create and Manage a database with team members, Projects, Assignments
data.<br/>
➢ Write an algorithm which will take the project requirements, team
members availability, skill level, tools preferred, etc. as input and assigns
the members for the new team.<br/>

## How we plan to carry out the project
### Algorithm Implementation
We plan to code the application in Python3. Python ML libraries will be used for
Cluster identification.<br/>
### Database Implementation:
We plan to store team members into an oracle database. Python files import the
data and process it and store the final result back to the database.<br/>
### Frontend Implementation:
Team members will be able to submit a form to consider them as part of project
assignment.
Final team assignment will posted on the homepage dashboard. We plan to
implement the dashboard and form using HTML, CSS, JavaScript



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Steps to run the application.

1. First and foremost you need to install NodeJS in your system. Please use this link as a guide to setup NodeJs<br> https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides

2. Then Fork/Clone the repository.

3. Open 2 different terminals and navigate to the repository.

4. Open NodeJS folder in terminal-1 and run the command "node server.js". This would setup the server for the application. Do not close the terminal until unless you want to close the application itself. The server runs at port 3001 on the localhost. Here is the link:http://localhost:3001

5. Now the next step is to run our client, for this in the home directory, using terminal-2 run the command "npm start". This would kick start your application and you will be navigated to the web page. The client runs at port 3000 on the localhost. Here is the link:http://localhost:3000

#### Note

If you face any errors in running the server or client dont worry that may be because of express version mismatch, Please run these commands in both home directory and NodeJS directory,

1. node uninstall express.

2. node install express.

3. node install

Running these 3 commands in both the locations, would help update the packages as per the requirement.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
